There is in the statue of Lord Nelson, on a tall column in Trafalgar Square, an effect which is greatly admired by the Americans who patronize Morley's Hotel on the Strand side of the Square. There is a similar--or even more so--effect in the statue of Captain Cook in Sydney, seen from one point of view. It's strange that these things are never foreseen. The sculptors must have had a rough time amongst their friends.\"Well, Phoebe, as I told you before, you can't expect to pick and choose; and if you want to be a favourite you ought to be civil to everybody. Now, Charlie Baker will speak against you and give you a bad name, and you don't know what influence his word may have. There are his cousins, the young Moores; you like them, they're nice looking young fellows, and Mrs Moore's brothers--in time, you know, if people spoke well of you, said what a nice sort of girl that is, they would come along and talk to you and find you really could talk, and then--\"Her first impulse was to go straight to Richard. But she had not covered half a dozen yards before she saw that this would never do. At the best of times Richard abominated gossip; and the fact of it having, in the present case, dared to fasten its fangs in some one belonging to him would make him doubly wroth. He might even try to find out who had started the talk; and get himself into hot water over it. Or he might want to lay all the blame on his own shoulders--make himself the reproaches Ned's Polly had not spared him. Worse still, he would perhaps accuse Purdy of inconsiderateness towards her, and fly into a rage with him; and then the two of them would quarrel, which would be a thousand pities. For though he often railed at Purdy, yet that was only Richard's way: he was genuinely fond of him, and unbent to him as to nobody else.Neville and\n"

Swear it by the love you once said you bore me!\"  She sank back exhausted and awaited my response. For a moment I dared not trust myself to speak, yet something must be said.  As I noted her impatience I replied: \"Lona, you have lifted a great weight from my heart and placed a lesser one upon it. Forgive me that I have ever doubted you.  Even as you have been true to yourself, I swear by the love I still bear you to deliver your message to Darrow Sahib and to no other human being.

There was no Oliphant to wait on us, and the inn servants were always about, so it was well to have a tongue they did not comprehend. The lady was distracted and sad.  When I inquired feelingly as to the general condition of her father's health she parried the question, and when I offered my services she disregarded my words.  It was in truth a doleful meal, while the faded Cristine sat like a sphinx staring into vacancy.  I spoke of England and of her friends, of Paris and Versailles, of Avignon where she had spent some years, and of the amenities of Florence, which she considered her home.  But it was like talking to a nunnery door.  I got nothing but \"It is indeed true, sir,\" or \"Do you say so, sir!\"  till my energy began to sink.  Madame perceived my discomfort, and, as she rose, murmured an apology.  \"Pray forgive my distraction, but I am poor company when my father is ill.  I have a foolish mind, easily frightened.  Nay, nay!\" she went on when I again offered help, \"the illness is trifling. It will pass off by to-morrow, or at the latest the next day.

Mark Romilly,\" he smiled here to himself, \"I'm afraid you're a gambler, my boy. You've won well enough already but you're going double or quits now, and no one knows better than you do that the luck doesn't hold for ever.\"When Marian, daughter of Nicholas Forsyte, married Edward Tweetyman in 1882, Nicholas was heard to say:  \"That chap'll never make money, she'd better have married his brother.\"  The remark, repeated on Forsyte 'Change, invited the family's dispassionate consideration of two individuals as far apart in character and appearance as is permitted by the laws of consanguinity and partnership.  The two Tweetymans were engineers by profession, and regrettably, it was felt, pump manufacturers in practice, having their business premises in King William Street.  Albert, the elder, was square and stocky in build, red and fleshy in face, with an early smile, and Georgian eyes that reminded one of a bull concerned with Europa.  He it was who took the orders, directed the operations, and made the money.  Edward, the younger, was a little taller and a great deal thinner, with a refined white face and hollowed temple bones; his weak hair waved faintly on his white forehead, his weak and fair moustache drooped like twin wisps of hay above a selfless smile, and his pale blue eyes looked wistfully forth with the saintlike fervour of an inventor.  He invented the pumps, or at least understood how they worked, had a passion for truth, and lived as it were at the bottom of the wells for which they were both designed.  Incidentally he received what his brother didn't.  It was not much.  But being of a loyal and unassuming nature he was not conscious of the discrepancy.

My wild Mallard ducks breed all winter and calves and pigs may be born at any time.  Yet there is a resurgence of the life sap, no matter how subtle, for the creatures and birds as well as for the trees.  The red-birds sing all through the winter and I have awakened to delirious duets on a morning when icicles hung from the water-tower and the oranges were frozen solid.  The red-birds' song has to do with their mating, for it is the males who proclaim in season the delights of love and the glory of the world.
